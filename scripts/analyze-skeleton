=== SKELETON STRUCTURE ANALYSIS ===

From converter output, analyzing joint positions to verify humanoid structure.

Key joints to verify:
- model_root: origin
- pelvis: center of hips (should be ~0.9 above root)
- lfemurYZ/rfemurYZ: hip joints (should be at pelvis level, left/right offset)
- ltibia/rtibia: knees (should be ~0.4 below hips)
- ltalus/rtalus: ankles (should be near ground level)
- thoracic: upper spine (should be above pelvis)
- cervical: neck (should be above thoracic)
- cranium: head (should be at top)
